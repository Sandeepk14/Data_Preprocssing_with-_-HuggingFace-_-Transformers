# Data_Preprocssing_with_HuggingFace_Transformers
preprocessing text data is crucial for NLP tasks. Hugging Face's transformers library simplifies this process by offering efficient tokenization, padding, truncation, and numerical transformation for deep learning models.

# Key Steps in Preprocessing with Hugging Face:
1. Load a pretrained Model Tokenizer
2. Tokenization: Convert text into subword tokens
3. Convert Tokens to IDs
4. Batch Encoding (Padding & Truncation): Ensures uniform input sizes.
5. Decoding: Convert back to readable text

# Why Use Hugging Face for Preprocessing?
1. Handles Special Tokens (e.g., [CLS], [SEP]) ✅ 
2. Supports Multiple Models (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.) ✅ 
3. Optimized for Speed & Scalability✅
